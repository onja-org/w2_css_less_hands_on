   THE SITUATION: A Client's Website
   ======================================== */
/*
   SCENARIO: You're building a website for "Heritage Weavers", a family-owned
   rug-making business. They've been using a warm terracotta color
   throughout their site to represent their traditional craftsmanship.

   But now they want to modernize their brand! The owner calls: "We love the
   website, but can you change our signature color to this beautiful teal
   to appeal to younger customers?"

   Your job: Update ALL instances of the brand color throughout the stylesheet.
   Sound simple? Let's see how many places you need to change...

/* ========================================
   TASK 1A: THE MANUAL APPROACH (Feel the Pain!)
   ======================================== */
/*
   🎯 TASK: Update ALL instances of the old color to the new teal

   Instructions:
   1. Go through the CSS above and change EVERY instance of the terracotta
      color to the new teal color
   2. Also change the darker version to a darker teal
   3. Update the rgba values too
   4. As you work, keep a count of how many places you had to change
   5. Run `npm run compile:ex1` and open demo.html to see your changes

   Don't worry if this feels tedious - that's the point!
   Count how many places you changed: _____ (write your answer here)
*/
/* ========================================
   TASK 1B: WHAT WENT WRONG?
   ======================================== */
/*
   After you've made all those changes, think about these questions:

   💭 REFLECTION QUESTIONS:
   1. How many different places did you have to update?
   2. What happened if you missed one? (Try leaving one unchanged and see!)
   3. What if the client changes their mind again tomorrow?
   4. What if you had a 2000-line stylesheet instead of this small example?
   5. How confident are you that you found ALL the instances?

   This is exactly the problem that CSS preprocessor VARIABLES solve!
*/
/* ========================================
   TASK 1C: THE SOLUTION - LESS VARIABLES
   ======================================== */
/*
   🎓 LEARNING TIME: What are Variables?

   Variables in LESS (and other preprocessors) store reusable values.
   Instead of repeating color codes everywhere, you define them once
   and use the variable name throughout your stylesheet.
   When you need to change the color, you update it in ONE place!

   LESS variables:
   - Start with @ symbol (SCSS uses $ instead)
   - Store colors, numbers, strings, even complex values
   - Make your CSS maintainable and consistent
   - Compile to regular CSS (browsers never see the @ symbol)
*/
/* ========================================
   TASK 1D: REFACTOR WITH VARIABLES
   ======================================== */
/*
   🎯 TASK: Now go back up to the CSS and replace ALL the hard-coded colors
   with your variables!

   For example, change:
   .header { background: teal-color-code-here; }

   To:
   .header { background: variable-name-here; }

   🔥 PRO TIP: For rgba colors, you can use LESS color functions:
   Instead of: rgba(22, 160, 133, 0.1)
   Use: fade(variable-name, 10%)   // 10% opacity

   Other useful LESS color functions:
   - darken(color-variable, 10%)  // Make it darker
   - lighten(color-variable, 10%) // Make it lighter
   - fade(color-variable, 50%)    // Add transparency
*/
/* ========================================
   TASK 1E: TEST THE POWER OF VARIABLES
   ======================================== */
/*
   🎯 FINAL TASK: Experience the magic!

   Now that you've refactored everything to use variables:

   1. Run `npm run compile:ex1` to see your current teal theme
   2. Change JUST the main color variable to a different color:
      Try: orange, purple, or yellow hex codes
   3. Run `npm run compile:ex1` again
   4. Open demo.html and see how the ENTIRE site updates!

   Compare this to Task 1A where you had to find and change dozens of places!

   🎉 You've just experienced why preprocessors are essential tools
   for modern web development!

/* ========================================
   WHAT YOU LEARNED
   ======================================== */
/*
   ✅ THE PROBLEM: Hard-coded values scattered throughout CSS
      - Difficult to maintain and update
      - Easy to miss instances when making changes
      - No single source of truth for design values

   ✅ THE SOLUTION: CSS Preprocessor Variables
      - Define values once, use everywhere
      - Single place to update design decisions
      - More maintainable and consistent code
      - LESS uses @ symbol, SCSS uses $ symbol

   ✅ LESS FEATURES YOU USED:
      - Variables with @ symbol
      - Color functions: darken(), lighten(), fade()
      - Comments that compile away

   🚀 NEXT STEPS: In Exercise 2, you'll see how MIXINS solve the problem
   of repetitive CSS patterns (like button styles)!
